# Issue #387: install.sh's runtime install (install_asset calls) and
# scripts/lib/update.sh's runtime sync (file_pairs) are two hand-maintained
# lists of the same ~/.acfs runtime. holds.sh was in the update list but not
# the install list, so the `acfs hold` remediation printed by the checksum
# error did not exist on a fresh install. These tests pin the two lists to
# each other for every scripts/lib/*.sh runtime library so they cannot drift
# apart again, and check holds.sh specifically.
